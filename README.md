## Results

### Top 5 Most Important Features
1. **Genre** - Most influential predictor
2. **Energy** - Higher energy → more popular
3. **Danceability** - Danceable songs perform better
4. **Loudness** - Louder tracks correlate with popularity
5. **Energy × Danceability** - Engineered feature (interaction effect)

### Key Insights
- 🎸 **Genre Matters**: Pop, hip-hop, and electronic dominate
- ⚡ **Energy Wins**: High-energy songs are 2x more likely to be popular
- 💃 **Make It Danceable**: Danceability has strong positive correlation
- 🔊 **Turn It Up**: Louder songs (>-5dB) perform better
- ⏱️ **Sweet Spot**: 3-4 minute songs are optimal
- 🎹 **Less Acoustic**: Electronic production outperforms acoustic

### Business Impact
